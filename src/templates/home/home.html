        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The UW senior capstone team has been tasked with developing a process to detect cybersecurity events on aircraft using an automated process. The website will be built using a three-tier architecture, consisting of a presentation layer, an application layer, and a data layer. The presentation layer will include a user interface that allows users to view and interact with the system. The application layer will contain the business logic and algorithms for detecting anomalies in the data. The data layer will store and organize the data.</p>

        <h2>System Design</h2>
        <p>The system will be built using a three-tier architecture, consisting of a presentation layer, an application layer, and a data layer. The presentation layer will be developed using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application layer will be developed using Python and various machine learning libraries. The data layer will be implemented using a relational database management system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. The system will be deployed on a cloud platform such as AWS or Google Cloud Platform.</p>
